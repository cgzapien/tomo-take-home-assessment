# Tomo Spice Blend Take Home Challenge

FIRST: thank you so much for investing time and energy into this process with us. We're very grateful!

SECOND: The goal for this challenge is for you to highlight your technical strengths on the Front-End. Do your best, and spend the time you need to give us a clear understanding of your technical skills and interests. We'll review your submission, and then spend the majority of the follow up interview discussing your solution.

## Background

We're working on a spice blend application. This is important because spices make food delicious. We have a single page React app that we've started and we would like to enhance this application in a number of ways to offer our spice blend clients a better experience. 

## Getting Started

Run "npm install" and then "npm start". This should install the application in its entirety, open a webpage to localhost:3000, and watch for any of your changes in order to hot reload the page. You'll need node/npm installed (hopefully you have those already...), and it should work. If you run into troubles, consider those a challenge, and document what you needed to do to get the application running.

## Tasks

We have a lot to get done, and we want you to feel empowered to solve issues however you think is best and to show off your strengths! Feel free to add any libraries/dependencies/etc (you'll just want to explain your choices). Our home route does some good work of fetching a list of spices and blends and then having a basic details page (data not super factual), for each spice. We need to accomplish the following items:

* Add an Input(s) and "search" button above the spice list.
* Filter the spice list to the matching spices upon search.
* CSS styling for home page to match the mock provided in /public/mock.png
* One unit test (sample provided).
* One new "feature" or "refactor" that shows what you consider to be your FE strengths (css, js, etc)
* Bonus: responsive styling for the spice list page to enable mobile users to enjoy tomo-spice!
* Extra Bonus: Add a form to accept a "new blend", this should include a name, description, heat, color, price. As well as the option to select any number of spices to add to the blend. 

## Technical Background

We're using React and create-react-app to let us get up and running quickly. We haven't done much in the ways of customization here, and we've elected not to use typescript by default (but feel free to change that if you'd like). 

An interesting piece is that we're using MirageJS to mock out the backend and to allow us to have full stack interactions. You'll be able to query against those requests as if there was an actual API service on the backend. If you're so interested, you may even add/alter/research some of those mocked endpoints in the backend folder. 

NOTE: Network requests will get logged in the console, and will not show up in your network request tab within dev tools.

You can run prettier over your code at anytime by running the "npm run format" command. This will make your code standarized and more readable for us.

## How to submit?

Any way that we can see your work is fine. Having a github repo you can share with us, zip folder, ETC. Again, the key here is to allow us to get a little insight into your development skills and allow us to have a follow up discussion.
